  <p>The way I created a favicon was I went on Google Sheets and used the bucket tool to create a colorful favicon. The favicon was 32x32 bits so I made a person holding the Bangladesh flag inside of that and made it colorful. I then took a screenshot of my favicon and then I saved it as a jpg. The way I took the screen shot was I pressed Windows +Shift + S. I renamed it into "Favicon". After that, I went on replit and in my code which I referred to and inserted it into my code. After this, the favicon was able to show up and my website finally was able to display the favicon right next to my title.</p>
